# Code-review
Coding Foundations Repository

Welcome to my personal repository dedicated to improving and solidifying my programming skills. This is where I’ll be uploading a wide variety of practice projects, challenges, and mini-applications as I revisit and reinforce core computer science and software development concepts.

# 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves as:
- A structured space to practice and build foundational coding knowledge.
- A portfolio of completed projects that demonstrate growth and consistency.
- A tool to track progress toward becoming a more confident and capable developer.

# 🛠️ Topics Covered

The projects in this repository will touch on topics such as:
- **Data Structures & Algorithms**  
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**  
- **Backend Development (APIs, Databases, etc.)**  
- **Frontend Concepts (HTML, CSS, JS Basics)**  
- **Version Control with Git & GitHub**  
- **Scripting and Automation**  
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**  
- **Code Style & Best Practices**
- **Leet code**

# 📂 Repository Structure
